to know how he was employing his extraordinary
powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as
I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice
in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk
upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.'''
